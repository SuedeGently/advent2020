# Advent of Code 2020 #

These are solutions to some of the challenges present in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2020. This is mostly just so I can get my coding skills back up to industry standards after another year of uni. Will initially be written in Rust; I might explore other languages a bit later on.
